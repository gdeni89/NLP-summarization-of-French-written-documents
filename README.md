# NLP-summarization-of-French-written-documents
Our goal will be to implement and compare different approaches to produce a summary from a given text. As a "baseline", we will implement the more "naive" method to adress this task, which is called "Extractive Approach" and is unsupervised : the idea is to choose some embeddings for the sentences of a text, and compute a similarity matrix to form a summary by extracting the most revelant sentences of our text. Then, we will study the more advanced "Abstractive approach", where the idea is to leverage deep learning models (Encoder-Decoder or Attention Mechanism of Transformers), to build supervised generative models that will generate new sentences to create a summary.
